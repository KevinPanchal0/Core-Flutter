## Features
Analogue Clock: For those who appreciate the timeless elegance of traditional clock faces, our Analogue clock offers a beautiful display of hour, minute, and second hands, providing a visually appealing way to keep track of time.

Digital Watch: If you prefer a more modern and straightforward approach, our Digital watch presents time in clear, easy-to-read digits. It's perfect for quick glances and precise timekeeping.

Strap Watch: Designed for convenience and style, the Strap watch combines the functionality of a digital display with the comfort of a wrist strap. It's a versatile choice for everyday wear.

Timer Watch: Need to time an activity or track your progress? Our Timer watch comes with a range of features. You can set it to start from any user-decided minute and second, and it works in reverse, counting down to zero. It also includes a flag system to mark laps or important moments, making it ideal for workouts, cooking, or any timed activity. Plus, you have the options to start, stop, and reverse the timer as needed.

With our user-friendly interface, you can switch between these watch types effortlessly, allowing you to choose the style and functionality that suits your needs at any moment. Whether you're keeping track of time in a meeting, timing your workout sessions, or simply admiring the artistry of a classic clock face, our watch application has everything you need.
